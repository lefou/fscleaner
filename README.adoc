= FsCleaner

Tool to automate the tasks of cleaning directories.

The deletion process is controlled via configuration files.

In later versions, it is planned to add a scan mode, which analyses directories and makes suggestions about possible delete candidates like: Maven caches and repos, bin- and target folders, ...

More ideas: 

- move files instead of delete
- call external tools to delete content like e.g. `make clean`


== Configuration

fscleaner looks for a `.fscleanerrc` in each directory it visits.

Example config:

----
# it's safe to delete this files and directories recursively
delete: [
  .cache
  download-cache
]

# apply that to each sub directory when running recursively
pattern.delete: [
  target
]
----

You need at least Maven 3.3.1 to build this project.
